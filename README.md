Just an other HTML5 Framework starting from Boilerplate with SCSS.


First of all, you need to download this folder.

After that, just drag and drop the index.html file in the Prepros software.

Clic on the picto "Open Live preview" (the globe) and add your SCSS in css/main.scss.
Each time you'll save, Prepros will compile all files and reload the page. :)
